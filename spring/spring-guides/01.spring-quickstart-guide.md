# Spring快速入门指南

**构建什么**

You will build a classic "Hello World!" endpoint which any browser can connect to.

You can even tell it your name, and it will respond in a more friendly way.

**需要什么**

+ 集成开发环境（IDE）
    + [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    + [Spring Tools](https://spring.io/tools)
    + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)
    + [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
+ Java开发工具（JDK）
    + [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

## 步骤1：创建Spring Boot项目

Use [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to create a "web" project.

In the "Dependencies" dialog search for and add the "web" dependency as shown in the screenshot.

Hit the "Generate" button, download the zip, and unpack it into a folder on your computer.

Projects created by [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) contain [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), a framework that makes Spring ready to work inside your app, but without much code or configuration required.

Spring Boot is the quickest and most popular way to start Spring projects.

## 步骤2：添加代码

Open up the project in your IDE and locate the **`DemoApplication.java`** file in the **`src/main/java/com/example/demo`** folder.

Now change the contents of the file by adding the extra method and annotations shown in the code below.

You can copy and paste the code or just type it.

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
        return String.format("Hello %s!", name);
    }

}
```

The **`hello()`** method we've added is designed to take a **`String`** parameter called **`name`**, and then combine this parameter with the word **`"Hello"`** in the code.

This means that if you set your name to **`"Amy"`** in the request, the response would be **`"Hello Amy"`**.

The **`@RestController`** annotation tells Spring that this code describes an endpoint that should be made available over the web.

The **`@GetMapping("/hello")`** tells Spring to use our **`hello()`** method to answer requests that get sent to the **`http://localhost:8080/hello`** address.

Finally, the **`@RequestParam`** is telling Spring to expect a **`name`** value in the request, but if it's not there, it will use the word **`"World"`** by default.

## 步骤3：试一试

Let's build and run the program.

Open a command line (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where you have the project files.

We can build and run the application by issuing the following command:

**MacOS/Linux**:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Windows**:

```shell
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You should see some output that looks very similar to this:

<img src="images/0102.spring-quickstart-guide.png" width="85%"/>

The last couple of lines here tell us that Spring has started.

Spring Boot's embedded Apache Tomcat server is acting as a webserver and is listening for requests on **`localhost`** port **`8080`**.

Open your browser and in the address bar at the top enter [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello).

You should get a nice friendly response like this:

**随堂测试**

What should happen if you add **`?name=Amy`** to the end of the URL?
